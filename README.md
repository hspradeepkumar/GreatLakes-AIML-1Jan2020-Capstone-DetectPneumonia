This is the AIML-1 Jan2020 batch capstone project 
This repository consists is build to collabarate wiht follwoign team to develop a solution pertaining to Pneumonia Detection Challenge using Deep Learning with the help of medical imaging data provided by Kaggle.

Refer the link for  problem description:
